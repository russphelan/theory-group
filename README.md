This integro-differential equation solver was written to solve an equation for Professor John Donoghue and Basem El-Menoufi, to assist with their work in Quantum Loop Gravity. It can be easily modified to solve similar equations of the form laid out in the documentation. 

I would like to thank John Donoghue, Basem El-Menoufi, Panayotis Kevrekidis, and William “Bill” Barnes for useful conversations and inspiration related to this project. This work has been supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grants NSF PHY15-20292 and NSF PHY12-25915.

You may need to modify your Matlab PATH to work with the folder structure in this program.

The 'main' file is solver.m.

Documentation can be found in the folder by that name. This documentation is a work-in-progress as of 2/13/17. I hope that it can be helpful in some way.
