Numerical equation solving programs for John Donoghue's theory group at UMass Amherst. 

Solves integro-differential equations. Currently set up to solve an equation for the scale factor in general relativity, correcting for quantum effects from the theory of quantum loop gravity.

With a few simple changes, it should be adaptable to solve any integro-differential equation of similar form. I've laid out the basic structure in the documentation, as well as the form of the equation it was intended to solve.
